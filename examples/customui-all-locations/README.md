# CustomUI: All locations example

**You must use a version of git that supports symbolic links or copy the customui experiment into the experiments folder to use this example.**

This example is primarily intended for testing and to easily discover where locations are available; it registers two customUI frames on each available location using default options, each displaying their context as JSON and providing some dynamic actions.
