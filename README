This repository contains WebExtension experiments developed for the GeneralSync
integration add-on. If you want to see them in action, you can download the
proprietary add-on (with unobfuscated sources!) from https://generalsync.com/

The long-term goal is to get these APIs (or functional equivalents) either
merged into Thunderbird or at least into some sort of Library where extension
developers can get them from. Until that goal is reached, I will try to keep
this repository in sync with the GeneralSync add-on. That being said, a more
recent version may be available as part of the GeneralSync add-on.

I tried to design the APIs in a generic way, but only specified and implemented
parts that were necessary for GeneralSync. For example, the TCP experiment only
covers client sockets, while it would be reasonable to also support server
sockets through the same API â€“ and the customui experiment only supports
injecting UI in some selected situations where I needed it, while there are
many other locations that could be useful for other add-ons.
